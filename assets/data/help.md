## Adding a Character
To add a new character, you must specify a name as well as an HP for the new character. You may also choose to manually enter in an initiative, or have the app auto-roll for you using the number and type of dice specified in the [settings](#settings). In order to auto-roll, just leave the initiative field blank.

If you would like to add more than one of the specified character, you can select an amount (1 - 20) from the dropdown to the right of the name entry

## Settings
You can specify what type of theme you would like to use, as well as the number and type of dice you would like to use for auto-rolling the initiative.
