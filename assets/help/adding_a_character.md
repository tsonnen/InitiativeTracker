# Adding a Character
To add a new character, tap on the plus (+) sign on the main screen. From here, specify how many of the unit you would like to add, as well as the name, notes, and HP (if set to display in the settings). You can also choose to either specify an intiative or an intiative mod, depending on what is selected in the settings. The number of dice, as well as the number of sides when using the auto roll feature can be specified in the settings as well.

If you would like to add more than one of the specified character, you can select an amount (1 - 20) from the dropdown to the right of the name entry.
