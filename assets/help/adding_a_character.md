# Adding a Character
To add a new character, you must specify a name as well as an HP for the new character. You may also choose to manually enter in an initiative, or have the app auto-roll for you using the number and type of dice specified in the [Settings](help:settings). In order to auto-roll, just leave the initiative field blank. By default, the initiative modifier will be 0, if you would like a different value, you can choose an amount (-5 - 5) from the dropdown.

If you would like to add more than one of the specified character, you can select an amount (1 - 20) from the dropdown to the right of the name entry.
